# Stratiqty
LQTY Strategic Reserve Initiative 

## How does it work?

1. The Stratiqty Initiative uses Liquity Governance "initiative" template: https://github.com/liquity/V2-gov/
2. Bribes to the Liquity governance gauges incentivise LQTY stakers to vote on the Stratiqty initiative
3. The guages automatically direct a small percent of protocol revenue to Initiatives with the most votes.
4. The Stratiqty initiative sends 100% of BOLD tokens earned from the gauges to a Multi-sig controlled by a group of trusted community members, professional traders, professional risk analysts, and (non-team)
5. The multi-sig enacts a long-only strategy to buy LQTY strategically and effectively, avoiding MEV and value leakage. 

If the amount of LQTY in the reserve becomes large enough to warrant the investment in more dev time, we can upgrade the control over the reserve to a delegate DAO or other model instead of a multi-sig.
